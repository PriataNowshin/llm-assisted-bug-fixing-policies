1.1002E+11,,,,,,,,"- It's about establishing a practice and framework around it. As soon as the framework is enforced through dedicated practice under the right governing board and tools, it is not time-consuming   - Different personal preferred tools might not be acceptable, but those are for the benefit of the data and security, and my organisation will not compromise on that. However, this might get uncomfortable for certain developer groups, but sooner or later they can find alternative tools that also bring the same value for them. In the case of some essential tools, we need to place the proper framework and practice around the people and process  - In the absence of a dedicated governing body and the right framework, it might be very challenging for multi-national organisations as AI-related laws vary across jurisdictions. Disclosure requirements might complicate global operations, where standard practices in one region may conflict with rules elsewhere.  - I recently came across multiple acquisitions, and at the beginning, the developers from the new acquisition were complaining about micromanagement. However, as soon as they were introduced to the practice and process, they started to feel empowered because they knew their code and their tools were trusted and vetted. This is a common scenario for Enterprise organisations as their practices are mature and trusted; however, for startups and other organization it might be challenging ",Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Regulatory compliance,,Improving client trust and reputation,,,,,,,,,"Once you have celar guidelines, regular enablement for different roles and multiple checks to ensure that is being carried out as well as enough automation to assist in the review process, this is just standard practice.
